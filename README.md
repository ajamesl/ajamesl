## ðŸ“‚ Selected Projects

### ðŸ’¬ [MiniChat](https://github.com/ajamesl/mini-chat-llm)
[Live Demo](http://65.109.84.92:7000/)

A multilingual LLM chat assistant served with FastAPI, using a Qwen3 0.6B Base model fine-tuned via SFT and further optimised with RLHF (PPO). Clean, modern web UI with real-time, token-by-token streaming and full Docker support.

**Key Features:**
- Multilingual chat with advanced, RLHF-trained model.
- Responsive FastAPI+Docker backend; modern streaming UI.


### ðŸ¤– [MiniAgent](https://github.com/ajamesl/mini-whisper-agent)

A 24-hour project: a low-latency voice-activated AI agent that carries out browser tasks autonomously via voice commands.

**Key Features:**
- Fast, fine-tuned Whisper (tiny) model for robust voice recognition.
- Modular: easily extend commands or retrain on your own audio.
- Ready-to-use with pre-trained model included.
